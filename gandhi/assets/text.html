        Mahatma Gandhi dreamed of sustainable village industries that would supply employment and purpose to rural people. In today's hyper-urbanized world, when cities are swelling with discontented former farmers, the Bajaj Foundation is working to realize Gandhi's dream. In hundreds of villages, the Bajaj Foundation is supporting local people to develop alternative sources of income. In combination with sustainable farming, these income-generating projects can provide sufficient profit for rural families to thrive without leaving home. The Bajaj Foundation supports three main types of microenterprise: businesses run by women's self-help groups, village grocery shops, and indigenous cow promotion.<br>
        <br>
        The Bajaj Foundation has helped over sixty families begin small village grocery stores. These shops provide income to poor families and offer needed goods to remote communities.The grocery store program focuses on communities of indigenous people known in India as &quot;tribals.&quot; The Bajaj Foundation seeks to identify landless tribal people who lack material resources but have the determination to run a small store.<br><br>
        As an additional source of income, the Bajaj Foundation has helped hundreds of families purchase indigenous cows. These cows often provide families with enough milk to meet their own needs and still have surplus milk that can be sold. On average, each beneficiary earns an average of 100 rupees per day from selling surplus milk. In addition to surplus milk, cow dung can be sold to villagers who can use it for biogas plants or as organic fertilizer for sustainable farming. Cows also produce offspring that provide further value to the family.<br>

        Gandhi the weaver has been immortalized in images: the bespectacled Mahatma with his iconic spinning wheel. But few people understand the full significance of the charkha or spinning wheel. The charkha symbolizes Gandhi's emphasis on self-reliance and sustainable development. By making his own cloth and encouraging others to do the same, Gandhi strove to revolutionize the global economy and to end poverty.<br><br> Explore other examples of Gandhi's writings on the charkha and other forms of village industries.<br>

        Throughout the developing world, women walk miles every day to gather firewood. As nearby forests are depleted, women are forced to walk farther and farther or to buy expensive cooking fuel. Burning wood for fuel also forces women to inhale dangerous amounts of smoke, and pollutes the atmosphere, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. Meanwhile, another source of fuel, cow dung, lies exposed and unused, leaking more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.<br><br>
        Biogas systems convert cow manure into clean-burning cooking fuel. The manure from four cows produces enough fuel to satisfy the needs of a family. The Bajaj Foundation has constructed over 600 biogas units since 2009, transforming the daily lives of hundreds of families and contributing to the global fight against greenhouse gases. By capturing and using the gas produced by cow manure, biogas systems free women from the need to gather firewood, eliminate the harmful smoke associated with cooking, and help reduce greenhouse gases.<br>

        Gandhi believed in sustainability. Look at the farm he helped found in South Africa, Tolstoy Farm. Over a thousand acres, Tolstoy Farm boasted hundreds of fruit trees that produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, peaches, and figs. The farm was a model of sustainability. Water was transported manually from a nearby spring. Wastewater was gathered in buckets and used to water the trees. A compost system turned food waste into fertile manure. Human waste was also transformed into manure. Residents made their own sandals. It was, in Gandhi's words, &quot;a busy hive of industry.&quot;<br><br>

         "Throughout the developing world, women often work longer and harder than men, but are denied equality in employment and in the home. In Wardha, despite having relatively high literacy rates compared to the national average, most women lack the economic, social, and recreational opportunities available to men. The Bajaj Foundation has helped establish over a thousand women's self-help groups. By empowering women to become leaders in their communities, these women's collaboratives are transforming villages throughout Wardha.<br><br>
         Every month, thousands of women throughout Wardha gather in self-help groups. These collaboratives offer women the opportunity to pool their resources and to collectively discuss their challenges and their dreams. Most self-help groups require a small monthly contribution from each member. Usually 100 rupees ($2), these monthly contributions accumulate over time. Each group decides how to spend the funds. Many invest in a collaborative business venture.
         One women's self-help group built a daal (lentil) and spice processing machine. By grinding daal and spices for the local community, the machine earns income for the self-help group and provides a vital service to nearby farmers. In addition to economic opportunities, the collaboratives serve as a supportive community where women come together to discuss their problems and opportunities. Most villages lack a public space where women feel safe to gather as a group. The women's self-help groups provide such a safe space, in addition to a network of other women who are experiencing similar challenges.<br>"

         "Gandhi's relationship to women's empowerment is complex. Take his salt march, for example. Gandhi limited the salt march to men. At the same time, however, Gandhi helped women assume leadership positions in the larger struggle. Kasturba Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu, and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay were only the most prominent of dozens of women who assumed key roles in the movement. Gandhi later wrote that the salt protests &quot;brought out tens of thousands&quot; of women &quot;and showed that they could serve the country on equal terms with men.&quot; In 1946, a year before India gained independence, Gandhi reminded his fellow Indians of the &quot;heroism and sacrifice&quot; of women during the civil disobedience movement. The fact that the salt march was limited to men reveals the impact of prevailing stereotypes on Gandhi and his movement. Overall, however, the movement embodied Gandhi's vision of a society that respected women as leaders in all fields of endeavor.<br><br>Gandhi's comments on the &quot;heroism and sacrifice&quot; of women are available at <a href=&quot;http://www.gandhiserve.org/e/cwmg/cwmg.htm&quot;>here</a>.

         "The farmers of Wardha need water. Nearly 85 percent of rainfall occurs during the monsoon season. From June to September, torrential rains pound the fields, often causing soil erosion and water-logging. The remaining nine months of the year offer only limited and erratic rainfall. Water scarcity severely limits agricultural yields throughout Wardha District. To provide farmers with sufficient water, the Bajaj Foundation restores rivers, builds checkdams, digs farm ponds and wells, and provides drip irrigation systems. Their integrated approach to water management empowers farmers to conserve and efficiently use our most vital natural resource. <br><br>Many rivers and streams become silted by the runoff caused by heavy monsoon rains. As rivers fill with soil, their capacity decreases, causing water to flood nearby fields. Flooding further erodes the fertile top soil needed for cultivation. The Bajaj Foundation desilts river beds and reconstructs river banks to stop erosion and water-logging. As a result, farms gain productivity and avoid crop loss due to flooding.  River restoration helps to replenish the local water table and recharge wells, especially when combined with a check dam, small concrete structures that do not produce power, but rather slow the flow of a small stream or river in order to help restore the ground water.
         <br> <br>
         Rivers will need to be continually revived so long as heavy rainfall is allowed to run across fields, eroding valuable soil and clogging nearby streams. Farm ponds prevent soil erosion and enhance the recharge of ground water. Revived rivers, check dams, and farm ponds all help recharge the water table. Without the funds to dig a well, however, farmers would not be able to benefit from such initiatives. The Bajaj Foundation has helped dig hundreds of wells, providing crucial access to water for farmers throughout Wardha. The Bajaj Foundation also helps farmers use their water efficiently. Drip irrigation systems use plastic hoses to bring water directly to the roots of plants. Compared to traditional sprinkler systems, drip irrigation uses water more efficiently and effectively. <br>"

          "In December 1945, the governor of Bengal asked Gandhi for his advice on a proposed irrigation project that would redirect large amounts of water that would otherwise flow into the Bay of Bengal. &quot;If the waters of the rivers can be captured and utilized by the people of Bengal, instead of being wasted in the Bay,&quot; Gandhi replied, &quot;it would be a great gain.&quot; But he saw such a project as &quot;a long-term proposition&quot; whose success would depend on many factors. Overemphasis on large-scale, top-down projects was, he told the governor, &quot;a gross error&quot; that had been &quot;handed down from generation to generation by the British official element.&quot; &quot;Your gigantic project will come to nothing,&quot; he lectured the governor, &quot;until the whole mass of the people of Bengal is interested in the Government of the province.&quot; Such an interest was more likely to come from government initiatives aimed at empowering the grassroots and providing &quot;immediate individual relief&quot; to millions of villagers.<br>

          "Drive anywhere in rural Wardha and one crop will dominate your view: cotton. When the rains are good and prices are high, cotton can provide farmers with substantial profit. But often the rains are bad and prices are low. Over-reliance on cotton has depressed farmer income and created volatility and mounting debt throughout the region. To grow their cotton, many farmers rely on inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals pollute the soil and nearby streams and rivers. Given their high cost, they also cut into the farmer's profits. The Bajaj Foundation has helped establish over 700 organic farms, planted over 3000 small fruit orchards, and encouraged farmers throughout the region to move away from water-hungry mono-cropping to more sustainable and profitable crops.<br>"

          "In 1922, Gandhi wrote a story about farming. He called the story &quot;The Field and the Vadi&quot;—a vadi being a garden dedicated to fruits and vegetables. Gandhi's story took the form of a conversation between a mother and a child. The mother asked, &quot;Do you know what crops grow in our village?&quot; &quot;Yes, mother,&quot; the child replied, &quot;wheat, gram, bajra, tuvar, jowar, etc., according to the season.&quot; Pearl millet (bajra), pigeon pea (tuvar), sorghum (jowar)—this child knew her grains. And well she should, Gandhi implied, given the vital importance of growing a variety of crops. Just as our bodies require a varied diet, so farmers have learned the merits of agricultural diversity. Some plants, like millet and sorghum, are drought resistant. Some provide nitrogen for the soil. Others repel pesky bugs. By planting a variety of crops, farmers minimize their reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. For a poor farmer in India, there is an additional reason to plant diverse crops. With limited access to markets, growing a variety of foods is the best way to eat a variety of foods.<br> Gandhi's story is available at <a href=&quot;http://www.gandhiserve.org/e/cwmg/cwmg.htm&quot;>here</a>.
