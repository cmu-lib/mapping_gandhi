Throughout the developing world, women walk miles every day to gather firewood. As nearby forests are depleted, women are forced to walk farther and farther or to buy expensive cooking fuel. Burning wood for fuel also forces women to inhale dangerous amounts of smoke, and pollutes the atmosphere, releasing large amounts of carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. Meanwhile, another source of fuel, cow dung, lies exposed and unused, leaking more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Biogas systems convert cow manure into clean-burning cooking fuel. The manure from four cows produces enough fuel to satisfy the needs of a family. The Bajaj Foundation has constructed over 600 biogas units since 2009, transforming the daily lives of hundreds of families and contributing to the global fight against greenhouse gases. By capturing and using the gas produced by cow manure, biogas systems free women from the need to gather firewood, eliminate the harmful smoke associated with cooking, and help reduce greenhouse gases.

Drive anywhere in rural Wardha and one crop will dominate your view: cotton. When the rains are good and prices are high, cotton can provide farmers with substantial profit. But often the rains are bad and prices are low. Over-reliance on cotton has depressed farmer income and created volatility and mounting debt throughout the region. To grow their cotton, many farmers rely on inorganic fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals pollute the soil and nearby streams and rivers. Given their high cost, they also cut into the farmer's profits. The Bajaj Foundation has helped establish over 700 organic farms, planted over 3000 small fruit orchards, and encouraged farmers throughout the region to move away from water-hungry mono-cropping to more sustainable and profitable crops.
</p>
<p id="waterMGMT">
The farmers of Wardha need water. Nearly 85 percent of rainfall occurs during the monsoon season. From June to September, torrential rains pound the fields, often causing soil erosion and water-logging. The remaining nine months of the year offer only limited and erratic rainfall. Water scarcity severely limits agricultural yields throughout Wardha District. To provide farmers with sufficient water, the Bajaj Foundation restores rivers, builds checkdams, digs farm ponds and wells, and provides drip irrigation systems. Their integrated approach to water management empowers farmers to conserve and efficiently use our most vital natural resource. <br><br>Many rivers and streams become silted by the runoff caused by heavy monsoon rains. As rivers fill with soil, their capacity decreases, causing water to flood nearby fields. Flooding further erodes the fertile top soil needed for cultivation. The Bajaj Foundation desilts river beds and reconstructs river banks to stop erosion and water-logging. As a result, farms gain productivity and avoid crop loss due to flooding.  River restoration helps to replenish the local water table and recharge wells, especially when combined with a check dam, small concrete structures that do not produce power, but rather slow the flow of a small stream or river in order to help restore the ground water.


Rivers will need to be continually revived so long as heavy rainfall is allowed to run across fields, eroding valuable soil and clogging nearby streams. Farm ponds prevent soil erosion and enhance the recharge of ground water. Revived rivers, check dams, and farm ponds all help recharge the water table. Without the funds to dig a well, however, farmers would not be able to benefit from such initiatives. The Bajaj Foundation has helped dig hundreds of wells, providing crucial access to water for farmers throughout Wardha. The Bajaj Foundation also helps farmers use their water efficiently. Drip irrigation systems use plastic hoses to bring water directly to the roots of plants. Compared to traditional sprinkler systems, drip irrigation uses water more efficiently and effectively.

Throughout the developing world, women often work longer and harder than men, but are denied equality in employment and in the home. In Wardha, despite having relatively high literacy rates compared to the national average, most women lack the economic, social, and recreational opportunities available to men. The Bajaj Foundation has helped establish over a thousand women's self-help groups. By empowering women to become leaders in their communities, these women's collaboratives are transforming villages throughout Wardha.

Every month, thousands of women throughout Wardha gather in self-help groups. These collaboratives offer women the opportunity to pool their resources and to collectively discuss their challenges and their dreams. Most self-help groups require a small monthly contribution from each member. Usually 100 rupees ($2), these monthly contributions accumulate over time. Each group decides how to spend the funds. Many invest in a collaborative business venture.
One women's self-help group built a daal (lentil) and spice processing machine. By grinding daal and spices for the local community, the machine earns income for the self-help group and provides a vital service to nearby farmers. In addition to economic opportunities, the collaboratives serve as a supportive community where women come together to discuss their problems and opportunities. Most villages lack a public space where women feel safe to gather as a group. The women's self-help groups provide such a safe space, in addition to a network of other women who are experiencing similar challenges.

Mahatma Gandhi dreamed of sustainable village industries that would supply employment and purpose to rural people. In today's hyper-urbanized world, when cities are swelling with discontented former farmers, the Bajaj Foundation is working to realize Gandhi's dream. In hundreds of villages, the Bajaj Foundation is supporting local people to develop alternative sources of income. In combination with sustainable farming, these income-generating projects can provide sufficient profit for rural families to thrive without leaving home. The Bajaj Foundation supports three main types of microenterprise: businesses run by women's self-help groups, village grocery shops, and indigenous cow promotion.

The Bajaj Foundation has helped over sixty families begin small village grocery stores. These shops provide income to poor families and offer needed goods to remote communities.The grocery store program focuses on communities of indigenous people known in India as &quot;tribals.&quot; The Bajaj Foundation seeks to identify landless tribal people who lack material resources but have the determination to run a small store.
As an additional source of income, the Bajaj Foundation has helped hundreds of families purchase indigenous cows. These cows often provide families with enough milk to meet their own needs and still have surplus milk that can be sold. On average, each beneficiary earns an average of 100 rupees per day from selling surplus milk. In addition to surplus milk, cow dung can be sold to villagers who can use it for biogas plants or as organic fertilizer for sustainable farming. Cows also produce offspring that provide further value to the family.

Gandhi believed in sustainability. Look at the farm he helped found in South Africa, Tolstoy Farm. Over a thousand acres, Tolstoy Farm boasted hundreds of fruit trees that produced almonds, walnuts, apricots, peaches, and figs. The farm was a model of sustainability. Water was transported manually from a nearby spring. Wastewater was gathered in buckets and used to water the trees. A compost system turned food waste into fertile manure. Human waste was also transformed into manure. Residents made their own sandals. It was, in Gandhi's words, &quot;a busy hive of industry.&quot;<br><br>

In 1922, Gandhi wrote a story about farming. He called the story &quot;The Field and the Vadi&quot;—a vadi being a garden dedicated to fruits and vegetables. Gandhi's story took the form of a conversation between a mother and a child. The mother asked, &quot;Do you know what crops grow in our village?&quot; &quot;Yes, mother,&quot; the child replied, &quot;wheat, gram, bajra, tuvar, jowar, etc., according to the season.&quot; Pearl millet (bajra), pigeon pea (tuvar), sorghum (jowar)—this child knew her grains. And well she should, Gandhi implied, given the vital importance of growing a variety of crops. Just as our bodies require a varied diet, so farmers have learned the merits of agricultural diversity. Some plants, like millet and sorghum, are drought resistant. Some provide nitrogen for the soil. Others repel pesky bugs. By planting a variety of crops, farmers minimize their reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. For a poor farmer in India, there is an additional reason to plant diverse crops. With limited access to markets, growing a variety of foods is the best way to eat a variety of foods.

In December 1945, the governor of Bengal asked Gandhi for his advice on a proposed irrigation project that would redirect large amounts of water that would otherwise flow into the Bay of Bengal. &quot;If the waters of the rivers can be captured and utilized by the people of Bengal, instead of being wasted in the Bay,&quot; Gandhi replied, &quot;it would be a great gain.&quot; But he saw such a project as &quot;a long-term proposition&quot; whose success would depend on many factors. Overemphasis on large-scale, top-down projects was, he told the governor, &quot;a gross error&quot; that had been &quot;handed down from generation to generation by the British official element.&quot; &quot;Your gigantic project will come to nothing,&quot; he lectured the governor, &quot;until the whole mass of the people of Bengal is interested in the Government of the province.&quot; Such an interest was more likely to come from government initiatives aimed at empowering the grassroots and providing &quot;immediate individual relief&quot; to millions of villagers.

<li>INDIAN VEGETARIANS-VI- November 30, 1896<br>
The only flaw that can be found in his mode of living is the paucity of baths. In a hot climate baths are very useful. While a Brahmin would have his bath twice a day, and a Vaisya once a day, a shepherd would have only one bath a week. I shall here again digress to explain the manner in which the Indian takes his baths. Generally, he has his baths in the river flowing near his town, but if he is too idle to go to the river, or is afraid of being drowned, or if there is no river near his town, he has his baths at home. There is no bath into which he can plunge. He takes water from a large vessel, placed near him, with a goblet and pours it over his body, because he believes that the moment you plunge into stagnant water you render it impure and, therefore, unfit for further use. For the same reason he would not even wash his hands in a basin, but have someone to pour it over his hands or do it himself by holding the goblet between his arms.</li>
<br>
<li>MEMORIAL TO CHAMBERLAIN- May 16, 1899<br>
The Government of the South African Republic have the 'power for sanitary purposes of showing them (Coolies, Arabs, &c.,) fixed streets, wards, and Locations for habitation', that is to say, in the respective townships, not the power to 'force' them, in the words of His Honour the late British Agent, 'into a small Location on a spot used as a place to deposit the refuse of the town without any water except polluted soakage in the gully between the Location and the town', which 'must inevitably result in malignant fevers and other diseases breaking out amongst them, whereby their lives and the health of the community in the town would be endangered.'</li>
<br>
<li>MEMORIAL TO CHAMBERLAIN- May 16, 1899<br>
Even if it were necessary to separate the Indian community from the European, it is difficult to understand why the former should be relegated to a place where they cannot trade, where there are no sanitary conveniences, and where there is no water supply.</li>
<br>
<li>LETTER TO BRITISH AGENT- July 21, 1899<br>
The fact that there are no sanitary arrangements there, no water, no police protection and that the place is situated in the vicinity of the place where the refuse of the town and night-soil are deposited, are minor considerations in comparison with the fact that it is situated at such a great distance as 4-miles with no population of any kind within practically a two-mile radius.</li>
<br>
<li>THE TRANSVAAL BAZAARS- August 1902<br>
We say then with the utmost confidence that the sites selected by the present Government, in most cases, are doubly so. An attempt has been made to remove the existing sites selected by the old Government further away, and with the exception of one or two cases where there were old sites, they have been retained. In almost all cases, at present they are veritable deserts, without sanitary conveniences, without any water laid on, without any buildings.</li>
<br>
<li>Malaria in Durban- April 22, 1905<br>
3.Water should not be allowed to collect in or around the house. Drains and gutters should be inspected, and pits and ditches filled up. 4. Where there are large pools of stagnant water, they should be sprayed with kerosene until the pits are filled up. 5. The authorities should be informed if water collects and stagnates, or there is an overgrowth of useless vegetation around the house within the premises.</li>
<br>
<li>Smallpox in Johannesburg- May 27, 1905<br>
The remedy lies in the people's own hands. To keep the tenements clean, to bathe daily, to keep water, milk, etc., clean, to put on clean clothes, and to let plenty of air and light into the house; these are the preventive measures for smallpox or any other illness. If anyone in the house catches the disease, the fact should immediately be intimated to the authorities.</li>
<br>
<li>JOHANNESBURG LETTER- April 28, 1907<br>
A strong communication appears in The Sunday Times on the subject of washing places at New Clare. The writer says that the wholeland at New Clare stinks with putrid air. Indian washermen, according to him, have defiled the washing places; the water is dirty and stinks, so that clothes washed in it are as good as not washed at all. The writer is afraid that some day an epidemic is bound to break out because of clothes washed in that water. The Indian washermen have to be careful about this. The washing place should be drained each time and filled again with clean water.</li>
<br>
<li>Sarvodaya – December 14, 1907<br>
Most of the rivers run out their courses unregulated, their marshy banks poisoning the wind. If dams are built across these rivers to direct the water flow as required, they will irrigate the soil and keep the atmosphere pure.</li>
<br>
<li>GENERAL KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HEALTH [-VIII]- July 15, 1911<br>
Water makes up more than 70 per cent. of our body. Without water, it is believed, the body would weigh 8 to 12 lbs. In all that we eat, there is more or less water. Yet we take proportionately little care of a thing which, for us, is very important. Diseases like the plague beset us because of our carelessness in the mater of air. Similar results follow from our carelessness regarding water. Typhoid often breaks out among troops in battle and the cause, it has been proved, is polluted water, because on the front soldiers have to drink whatever water they can get. Typhoid breaks out also among those who live in cities, and the cause is mostly bad water. Drinking bad water often gives rise to diseases like stone. There are two causes for contamination of water—one, that the water is found in places where it cannot remain pure, and two, that we sully the water. We ought not to drink water which is stores in or comes from a dirty place, and for the most part, we do not; but we do not hesitate to drink water which has been polluted by us through neglect.</li>

Gandhi's relationship to women's empowerment is complex. Take his salt march, for example. Gandhi limited the salt march to men. At the same time, however, Gandhi helped women assume leadership positions in the larger struggle. Kasturba Gandhi, Sarojini Naidu, and Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay were only the most prominent of dozens of women who assumed key roles in the movement. Gandhi later wrote that the salt protests &quot;brought out tens of thousands&quot; of women &quot;and showed that they could serve the country on equal terms with men.&quot; In 1946, a year before India gained independence, Gandhi reminded his fellow Indians of the &quot;heroism and sacrifice&quot; of women during the civil disobedience movement. The fact that the salt march was limited to men reveals the impact of prevailing stereotypes on Gandhi and his movement. Overall, however, the movement embodied Gandhi's vision of a society that respected women as leaders in all fields of endeavor.

Letter to Colonial Secretary: April 20, 1901

<li>Florence Nightingale: November 4, 1905<br>
No wonder that a country where such women are born is prosperous. That England rules over a wide empire is due not to the country's military strength, but to the meritorious deeds of such men and women.</li>
<br>
<li>Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar: November 4, 1905<br>
He did not rest satisfied with thus putting higher and elementary education on a sound footing. He saw that, without the education of girls, the education of boys alone would not be enough. He found out a verse from Manu which said that the education of women was a duty…It will now be clear to us how Bengal provides an example for the other parts of India to follow.</li>
<br>
<li>Letter to Lord Selbourne: May 21, 1906<br>
We have no hesitation in saying that the regulation is unreasonable, insulting, and totally uncalled for. If it is enforced, it will create irritation which will be difficult to allay. It is strange, indeed, that, with the innovations introduced, His Excellency can conclude his letter by saying that the permit work is being done    with &quot;as much consideration for the convenience of the applicants as is possible under all circumstances&quot;. Not until the age limit has been restored, not until Indian women are rendered free from unwarranted insult, not until Indian refugees can have their applications considered immediately on their receipt, can, in our humble opinion</li>
<br>
<li>Mr. Byte's Will: July 28, 1906<br>
To take the example of South Africa, there are few among us who have spent their money on the proper education of Indian children. It behoves us therefore to bear in mind such examples as Mr. Byte's. It is our prime duty to provide all the necessary means for the education of Indian children in South Africa. Our second duty is towards women's education.</li>
<br>
<li>DEEDS BETTER THAN WORDS- October 26, 1906<br>
It is the movement in England for women's right to vote, which the Government is unwilling to concede. The women therefore go to the House of Commons and harass the Members. They have sent petitions, written letters, delivered speeches and tried many other means…It is no wonder that a people which produces such daughters and mothers should hold the sceptre. Today the whole country is laughing at them, and they have only a few people on their side. But undaunted, these women work on steadfast in their cause. They are bound to succeed and gain the franchise, for the simple reason that deeds are better than words. Even those who laughed at them would be left wondering. If even women display such courage, will the Transvaal Indians fail in their duty and be afraid of gaol ? Or would they rather consider the gaol a palace and readily go there? When that time comes, India's bonds will snap of themselves.</li>
<br>
<li>Brave Women- January 12, 1906<br>
A vigorous movement is going on here for securing the franchise for women. When the Government showed willingness to grant special treatment in gaol to the brave daughter of the late Mr. Cobden, she replied, 'No matter how I suffer, I shall seek no favour from you. I am in gaol for my own and my sisters' rights, and I will live like a common prisoner till the franchise is granted.' Such words have stirred up public feeling in their favour, and the papers which used to ridicule them before have stopped doing so. Every Indian in the Transvaal should take to heart the example of these brave women.</li>
<br>
<li>Women's Education- January 26, 1907<br>
That India is very backward in the education of women is a fact that cannot be denied. But by admitting this, we do not mean to suggest that Indian women fail in their duty. We believe that, as there are in the world few men of any class who can compete with the Indians considered from all points of view, so are there few women anywhere in the world who can compare with Indian women. But this position can no longer be kept up in the present squalid, low and helpless state of India. The modern age is such that it does not allow anyone to remain in the same position. Those who do not want to go forward, or do not do so, must fall behind. In so far as this is true, we can see that Indian men have deliberately kept their women backward.</li>
<br>
<li>ASIATIC LAW AMENDMENT ORDINANCE- March 23, 1907<br>
With us the first flush of heroism is seen to die away soon. This is a time of real test. If the Transvaal Indians are prepared to go to gaol, they have nothing to fear. We cannot say whether the Imperial Government will cancel this Ordinance or not. We would suggest that every Indian male should call to mind, on this occasion, the great deeds of British women. Action is more necessary than talk</li>
<br>
<li>Brave Women of Britain- March 30, 1907<br>
We still receive cables from Britain regarding the struggle by some brave women. All of them go to gaol instead of paying fines. Though they have not won their rights so far, they have not lost heart. Instead, they believe that even though they themselves may not get the rights, their daughters will get them as a result of their struggle

Gandhi the weaver has been immortalized in images: the bespectacled Mahatma with his iconic spinning wheel. But few people understand the full significance of the charkha or spinning wheel. The charkha symbolizes Gandhi's emphasis on self-reliance and sustainable development. By making his own cloth and encouraging others to do the same, Gandhi strove to revolutionize the global economy and to end poverty.

<li>&quot;I know that many non-co-operators have no faith in the power of the charkha. There is only one way of convincing them: that those who have faith in the charkha should ply it with the greatest zest and encourage others.&quot; In this 1924 article published in Navajivan, Gandhi addresses the apathy and skepticism of Charkha work (&quot;Neglect of the Charkha&quot; Hindi Navajivan, April 5, 1924).</li>
<br>
<li>&quot;The failure of a charkha is felt by nobody; the failure of a Taluka mill will mean consternation among the people of the Taluka concerned.&quot; Published in Young India, June 26, 1924, Gandhi reflects in this article on the differences between machine spinning and hand spinning.</li>
<br>
<li>&quot;[The Charkha] is to be the precursor of every reform, and if I can only concentrate the attention of the nation upon the charkha, it will automatically solve all the other problems and pave the way for legislation where legislation is required.&quot; In this article published in Young India on August 27, 1925, Gandhi explains the Charkha as it relates to health and sanitation.</li>
<br>
<li>&quot;If you will yourself spin, the quality of spinning will improve. Those who spin for wages must naturally be impatient. They will continue to spin the count that they are accustomed to.&quot; &quot;My Kamadhenu&quot; was an article published on May 20, 1926. Gandhi provides a full summary of his reasons for advocating Charkha and its role within Indian society.</li>
<br>
<li>&quot;Truth is by nature self-evident. As soon as you remove the cobwebs of ignorance that surround it, it shines clear. That is just the sort of handicap under which the simple and straight movement of the spinning-wheel is labouring today.&quot; In this May 27, 1926 article, Gandhi responds to a skeptic of Charkha and addresses each criticism point-by-point. This article provides an excellent summary of Gandhi's vision of the Charkha.</li>

<li>&quot;For charkha is not one of the professions that you teach. A profession is for earning a livelihood, and if charkha was to be taught as a profession it should have no place on your syllabus. But it has a special purpose.&quot; Gandhi maintained a distinct view on education. In this speech at a National School on February 9, 1927, Gandhi discusses the role of the Charkha in Indian education.</li>

This is a map of the impact of one man, Mahatma Gandhi, on a remote region of central India called Wardha. Gandhi came to Wardha because of its remoteness and because of his most important supporters, the philanthropist Jamnalal Bajaj, offered land to build an ashram. The Sevagram Ashram, or "service village," would become Gandhi's last permanent home. In 2009 the surrounding Kamalnayan Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation, a trust established by the descendants of Jamnalal Bajaj, began to invest in the villages surrounding Gandhi's ashram. The Bajaj Foundation now works in over a thousand villages, supporting small-scale farmers through projects in water management, alternative energy, organic farming, village industries, and women's empowerment.

The staff of the Bajaj Foundation understands their work as a direct legacy of Gandhi. But that legacy is far from simple. While Gandhi was a staunch critic of modern technology, the Bajaj Foundation employs a variety of technology solutions. Gandhi himself never reconciled the inconsistencies within his own views on how to attack poverty. This map is a way to understand one man's legacy -- in all its rich complexity -- and it is a challenge. How can we end the poverty that continues to haunt the people of Wardha, and many rural communities in India and throughout much of the world?
